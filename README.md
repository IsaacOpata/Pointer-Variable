# Pointer-Variable
Writing a program that dynamically allocates an array large enough to hold a userdefined number of test scores. Once all the scores are entered,
the array should be passed to a function that sorts them in ascending order. Another function should be called that calculates the average score. 
The program should display the sorted list of scores and averages with appropriate headings. Using pointer notation rather than array notation 
whenever possible.
